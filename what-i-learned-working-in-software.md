# What I learned, working in Software

1\) Change only one thing at a time. Stuff breaks. Even talented and experienced programmers write code that breaks. If you change multiple things, and something's broken, you won't know which part is broken. You can improve the situation by making really good error handling. You should. However, to eliminate the problem, there is only one way. It's to change one thing, then check if it works, then change the next thing.

2\) ... more coming soon ... I really need to organize my notes from other sources. This can actually be the second lesson. **Have great organization!** Organizing the codebase/documentation/data for your professional job/team, but also organizing your personal notes/thoughts/tools/accounting/contacts.
