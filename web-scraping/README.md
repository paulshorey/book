Great guide for \(1\) detecting scrapers or \(2\) hiding your scraper



Just run Puppeteer on your CLI instead of subscribing to APIFY or some web service.

Also consider Playwright, which is a newer alternative to Puppeteer, can crawl as Firefox or generic Webkit. Not for me right now, but good to know about as an alternative.
