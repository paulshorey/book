# Random

TODO: WRITE TUTORIALS. THIS FOLDER IS JUST A START

## CDN for ES Modules: [https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm](https://www.jsdelivr.com/esm)

I have a raw ESM library: [https://github.com/paulshorey/universal-common-scripts/blob/master/functions/requests.js](https://github.com/paulshorey/universal-common-scripts/blob/master/functions/requests.js) or [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/paulshorey/universal-common-scripts@latest/functions/requests.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/paulshorey/universal-common-scripts@latest/functions/requests.js)  
JSDeliver finishes it \(compiles and builds it\)! Then serves it via CDN! Amazing! Get the built file here:[ https://esm.run/universal-common-scripts/functions/requests.js](https://esm.run/universal-common-scripts/functions/requests.js)

## My role model: [Dmitriy Akulov](https://dakulov.com/)

This group contributes to amazing web tools like [JS Delivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), Survive JS, Bash, etc. Led by this Russian guy: [https://dakulov.com](https://dakulov.com/). Based on their affiliations and quality of previous work, it seems if ProspectOne likes something, it's worth learning and using, because if it's not big now, it will be or at least could be very useful.
