# IDE

If you don't want to install and configure 50 plugins, just use WebStorm for out of the box functionality. Differences are subtle, but powerful.

Renaming a file or folder, for example. WebStorm automatically renames all the instances of that component, all references to it, and renames it in GIT \(instead of letting GIT think that the old name is deleted and new name is a newly created file\). Other IDEs don't do all that. Code hints are much better, for every edge case.
