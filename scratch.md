#### **HOW DOES IT WORK?**

**Rapid** – \(in comparison to many other therapies\) there is usually only a 1-3 number of sessions required per issue. 

**Transformational** – it gets to the root cause of your issue \(rather than deal with the symptoms\). Once this deepest, undesired, level is identified, it can be released. 

**Therapeutic** – it works on proven methods that can guide you, even if you are resistant to hypnosis, or letting go, or need a more supportive form of healing. 

**Permanent** – it is not a temporary fix that lasts only until another life-challenge appears and the old wound opens up. This method identifies, negotiates, and eliminates, the old undesired beliefs. After that, through a transformational process, new and desired beliefs can be installed in your neural pathways \(the ‘hardwiring’ part of the brain\). As a result, it leads to new feelings and behaviors installed at the deepest level of the subconscious mind.
