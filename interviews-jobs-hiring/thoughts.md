### What makes someone a "senior" developer?

It's more than just number of years of experience. I've been working in web/software for 11 years now, but only very recently do I feel like I can be a "senior" developer. Others can be senior after only 2 or 3 years. How is that so? Well in my case, I've been a lazy slacker for most of the time. Only a couple years ago I've decided to get serious about my career and technology.

* **Experience.**  Even someone who was a slacker for 10 years still had many more chances to acquire industry knowledge, personal wisdom, and professional expertise than someone with 1 year experience. Little wise  lessons picked up along the way. 
  * don't turn in a project the minute it's done, for example, but test, then test again, to not miss any obvious edge cases
  * a codebase is never finished, and future feature development is going to be harder than building the initial features
  * don't trust initial requirements, unless the organization has a good track record of steady and reliable communicating expectations
  * don't assume something my colleague's fault. First, assume it's I who broke it, and see if there's any obvious explanation
  * documentation documentation documentation, comments comments comments, testing testing testing
* **Leadership.** Must like the idea of helping others - not just with the latest tech \(junior devs can figure out latest tricks themselves\) - but with organizational and social wisdom. How to interpret requirements and feedback, how to anticipate future problems, how to structure an application to make it resilient and easy to refactor. A good leader must also want to be mentored by everyone, including and especially by more junior colleagues. A leader who is stuck in their own bubble, a know-it-all is not a good leader. A good leader must always be learning, because one person can never know everything.
* **Confidence.**  I sometimes worked with arrogant colleagues \(from juniors to managers\). It's such a pain. They make everything more difficult, more work than it needs to be. A good leader is not arrogant and trying to constantly prove themselves. They are humble. Humility is synonymous with confidence. Arrogance is the opposite of confidence. The reason I wrote "confidence" and not "humility" is because I've worked with people that were careful to seem humble through politeness, while actually being arrogant, and making bad decisions.
