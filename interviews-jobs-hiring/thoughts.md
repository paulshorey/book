### What makes someone a "senior" developer?

It's more than just number of years of experience. I've been working in web/software for 11 years now, but only very recently do I feel like I can be a "senior" developer. Others can be senior after only 2 or 3 years. How is that so? We'll in my case, I've been a lazy slacker for most of the time. Only recently I've decided to get serious about my career and technology.

* **Years of experience.**  Even someone who was a slacker for 10 years still had many more chances to acquire industry knowledge, personal wisdom, and professional expertise than someone with 1 year experience. Chances are, the experience is in there, available to be used when needed.
* **Leadership.** Must like the idea of mentoring others - not just in the latest tech \(junior devs can figure out latest tricks themselves\) - but with organizational and social wisdom. How to interpret requirements and feedback, how to anticipate future problems, how to structure an application to make it resilient and easy to refactor. A good leader must also want to be mentored by everyone, including and especially by more junior colleagues. A leader who is stuck in their own bubble, a know-it-all is not a good leader. A good leader must always be learning, because one person can never know everything.
* **Confidence.**  I've worked with plenty of arrogant colleagues \(from juniors to managers\). It's such a pain. They make everything more difficult, more work than it needs to be. A good leader is not arrogant and trying to constantly prove themselves. They are humble. Humility is synonymous with confidence. Arrogance is the opposite of confidence. The reason I wrote "confidence" and not "humility" is because I've worked with people that were careful to seem humble through politeness, while actually being arrogant, and making bad decisions.
