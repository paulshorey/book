# Questions to employers

## To tech team:

* What's your favorite programming language feature or technique, such as ES6 arrow functions, or being able to break out of a curly bracket code block? \(from any programming language you like to use, not just JavaScript\)
* Share a favorite web technology you use or want to use \(library, framework, architecture, online tool, documentation tool, testing tool, dev-ops tool\), name a few if you'd like.
* Do you ever have different preferences than your colleagues about what coding convention to use? Do you ever do pair programming? At this job, do you have any time at all to discuss preferences and architectures, or is it just "go go go!"?
* IF YOU WORK WITH REACT... Have you encountered this JSX Prettier bug??... when your IDE reformats to beautify and format the code, it removes spaces at the end of each line, before the next tag... but then there is no space between tags, or between text and tags, so two words get squished together without a space. It's so annoying! The fix is to end the line with `{" "}` or `&nbsp;` but that is not a great fix in my opinion, because when editing later, it gets in the way.

## To management:

* What project management software or technique do you use?
* What's a uniquely challenging part of running this company?
