# Technical documentation

[https://developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com) - Cloudflare uses a really great framework. See "how to contribute". That will explain how to set up your own.

> Good documentation should include two distinct elements â€” a **Guide** and an **API**:
>
> 1. The **Guide** builds concepts, providing examples, etc. [GitBook ](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook)is well suited to generate the Guide, supporting a variety of options, using standard [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
> 2. The **API** provides low-level specifics, with function signatures, details, etc. [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) \(a descendant of [JavaDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)\) is ideal to define the low-level API. Using this technique, the API is defined from embedded comments in the code itself.

See more info and tools **on the left nav menu**, expanded under "Technical Documentation"

This guide is outdated, but it could still work. Instead of reading the whole article, I'm just going to: 

1\) convert my JSDocs into markdown, 

2\) shove the files into my GitBook markdown folder,

3\) try to integrate links into GitBook navigation menu
