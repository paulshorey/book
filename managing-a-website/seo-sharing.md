# SEO / Sharing

#### Facebook debugger

Very useful - preview what a "share on facebook" post will look like. This will also give you an idea of what your site preview will look like when it's shared anywhere, including Notion/GitBook or other CMS. 

#### Subdomain vs Subdirectory

Since subdirectories are considered part of a single website, they are much easier to optimize and they maintain the same SEO benefits as the main domain. The site as a whole is more intuitive for users to navigate, as well. Additionally, editing or moving files containing custom code to a subdirectory is much easier. And any analytics data \(e.g. data gathered with Google Analytics\) will relate to the whole site.
