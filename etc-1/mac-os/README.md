# Mac OS

#### Check which Mac OS version:

`sw_vers` 

#### Sleep

To disable sleep, even with lid closed:  
`sudo pmset -a disablesleep 1`  
  
To revert, allowing sleep again:  
`sudo pmset -a disablesleep 0`

**Why newer Mac OS is terrible**

Not only did Apple ruin their once amazing hardware with 2016+ Macbooks, but they continue to remove features and cripple their products.

* Big Sur denies hardware acceleration to any web browser except to Safari. This is shamelessly anti-competitive and actually is illegal.
* Catalina + Big Sur have crippled video processing of older Macbooks. Older macbooks now will run much hotter or even overheat when using external displays. Time to give Apple more money.
